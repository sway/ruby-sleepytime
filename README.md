### sleepytime-ruby

A quick and dirty offline version of the website http://sleepyti.me, which I use to check for the most suitable time to set my alarm to.

I am usually too lazy to fire up the browser so I made this little script, which supplies the same information. This version support only the best time from now, but I will add the remaining functionality later as well.
